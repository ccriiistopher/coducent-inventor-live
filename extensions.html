This extension adds many functionalities of the RecyclerView for Kodular.\n\n\u003e RecyclerView makes it easy to efficiently display large sets of data. You supply the data and define how each item looks, and the RecyclerView library dynamically creates the elements when they're needed.As the name implies, RecyclerView recycles those individual elements. When an item scrolls off the screen, RecyclerView doesn't destroy its view. Instead, RecyclerView reuses the view for new items that have scrolled onscreen. This reuse vastly improves performance, improving your app's responsiveness and reducing power consumption.\n\nMore information at: \u003chttps://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/layout/recyclerview\u003e","thumbnail":["img/1.png","img/2.png","img/3.png","img/4.png","img/5.png","img/6.png"],"date":"October 15, 2021 3:09 AM","platforms":["Kodular","AppInventor","Niotron"],"eventBlocks":[{"name":"OnWidgetClicked","description":"Event generated when any widget is clicked.For this event to be fired by a widget, it must have the respective property,\"Clickable\".","values":[{"name":"position","types":["Number"]},{"name":"widgetName","types":["Text"]},{"name":"group","types":["Group"]}]},{"name":"OnWidgetLongClicked","description":"Event generated when any widget is long clicked.For this event to be fired by a widget, it must have the respective property,\"Clickable\".","values":[{"name":"position","types":["Number"]},{"name":"widgetName","types":["Text"]},{"name":"group","types":["Group"]}]},{"name":"OnBindingRequest","description":"Event launched when a group changes its position and needs to update its widgets.","values":[{"name":"position","types":["Number"]},{"name":"listItem","types":["Any"]},{"name":"group","types":["Group"]},{"name":"viewType","types":["Number"]}]},{"name":"OnBindingCustomView","description":"Event fired when the custom widget that is optionally configured in the RecyclerView is visible on the screen or needs to be updated."},{"name":"FastScrolled","description":"Event launched when the \"Listenable Scroll\" method finished and the group being navigated to is already visible on the screen.","values":[{"name":"position","types":["Number"]}]},{"name":"ItemSwiped","description":"Event launched when a group triggers a swipe action.Indicates whether the action corresponds to the right or left side.","values":[{"name":"position","types":["Number"]},{"name":"left","types":["Boolean"]},{"name":"right","types":["Boolean"]}]},{"name":"MultiSelectionOptionSelected","description":"Event triggered when an option is selected in multiple selection mode.","values":[{"name":"title","types":["Text"]},{"name":"selectedItems","types":["List"]}]}],"methodBlocks":[{"name":"AddSelectionIconOption","description":"Adds options with icons to the multi-selection bar.","info":["These options will be added to the selection bar.","The icon is the name of a file in assets or the path to an image file."],"values":[{"name":"title","types":["Text"]},{"name":"icon","types":["Text"]}]},{"name":"AddSelectionOption","description":"Adds options to the multi-selection bar.","info":["An option to select all items can be set with the SelectAllTitle property."],"values":[{"name":"title","types":["Text"]}]},{"name":"Build","description":"Finishes with the recyclerview configuration and adds it inside the specified component.","info":["It is preferable not to add it inside a Scroll Arrangement, but it can be added inside a Swipe Refresh Layout or other arrangement."],"values":[{"name":"component","types":["Component"]},{"name":"data","types":["List"]}]},{"name":"GetCurrentScrollPixels","description":"Returns the offset position the recyclerview is currently in, the value is returned in pixels."},{"name":"GetGroupForPosition","description":"Returns the group corresponding to an adapter position (linked to the number of items in the data list).
