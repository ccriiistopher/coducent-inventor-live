{"pageProps":{"extensions":[{"name":"Fancy RecyclerView 2","path":"fancy-recyclerview-2","description":"> RecyclerView makes it easy to efficiently display large sets of data. You supply the data and define how each item looks, and the RecyclerView library dynamically creates the elements when they're needed.\n>\n> As the name implies, RecyclerView *recycles* those individual elements. When an item scrolls off the screen, RecyclerView doesn't destroy its view. Instead, RecyclerView reuses the view for new items that have scrolled onscreen. This reuse vastly improves performance, improving your app's responsiveness and reducing power consumption.\n\nThis extension makes RecyclerView accessible for Kodular, AppInventor and the supported platforms.\nIt carries the best functionalities to make it possible to create long lists of data efficiently.","thumbnail":["img/1.png","img/2.png","img/3.png","img/4.png","img/5.png","img/6.png"],"date":"November 24, 2021 10:28 PM","platforms":["AppInventor","Kodular","Niotron"],"eventBlocks":null,"methodBlocks":null,"propertyBlocks":null,"shortDescription":"This extension makes RecyclerView accessible for Kodular, AppInventor and the supported platforms.\nIt carries the best functionalities to make it possible to create long lists of data efficiently."}]},"__N_SSG":true}
